  "description": "Peyote Pay is a fungible asset, taking form as a virtual token version of the cactus Lophophora Williamsii. This Cactus has been used for generations as a means of transcendence, spiritual journeys and awakenings, and ritualistic experiences. Peyote Pay aims to become a pervasive coinage that can be used to trade for goods and services between those who recognize it's value.",
